This repositorie gather all custom codes used during my M2 internship in GirardeauLab. All codes are using the FMA toolbox available at : http://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net/

Codes are divided in 4 main folders. Function runs in a single session and saves it's output in a given session. FunctionAll checks in all sessions whether data from the first first function have been produced in order to reunite them and make statistics.

## Signal Analysis
This folder contains code relative to the analysis of LFPs. 

## Unit Analysis

## Behavior
This folder contains code relative to behavioral data. Like speed and position of the rat

In all of those folder you can find code for session, for all sessions and in order to plot the data.
